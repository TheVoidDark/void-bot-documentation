# Commands

### Prefix is `!`

## Basic Commands

1. `!ping` - Void will respond with _pong!_. This is useful if the bot is not responding.
2. `!version` - Void will tell you what version the bot is currently in.
3. `!clear` - Delete messages from 1-100. The limit is necessary to avoid the bot from _crashing_.

## Music

4. `!play` - Put a YT link _(Spotify will not work)_ or a name of a YT video.
5. `!leave` - The bot will leave the voice channel!


#### More commands will be added through updates. Keep check!
