# Commands

### Prefix is `!`

1. `!ping` - Void will respond with _pong!_. This is useful if the bot is not responding.
2. `!version` - Void will tell you what version the bot is currently in.
3. `!clear` - Delete messages from 1-100. The limit is necessary to avoid the bot from _crashing_.

#### More commands will be added through updates. Keep check!
